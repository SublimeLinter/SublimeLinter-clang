SublimeLinter-clang 2.0.0
-------------------------


We revamped the settings, and you probably have to make changes.

* If you used 'include_dirs', it is now called 'I' (just like the arg
  on the command line).

* 'extra_flags' is now 'args' (which is the standard name in the
  SublimeLinter world). Note that 'args' has the default value
  '-Wall -fsyntax-only -fno-caret-diagnostics'.

'c' and 'c++' files now have different settings sections.

{
    "linters": {
        "clang": {    // <- for c files

        },
        "clang++": {  // <-  for c++ files

        }
    }
}
